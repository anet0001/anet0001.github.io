          </header>

          <ul>
            <li>
              House cats possess a diverse range of vocalizations and body
              language to communicate with humans and other animals. They use
              meowing, purring, hissing, growling, and even chirping sounds to
              express their needs, emotions, and intentions. Additionally, their
              body postures, tail movements, and ear positions convey various
              messages, such as playfulness, fear, or aggression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite their cute and cuddly appearance, house cats are
              exceptional hunters with remarkable agility and precision. They
              possess sharp retractable claws and keen senses that allow them to
              stalk and catch prey effectively. Even well-fed house cats may
              display hunting behaviors, such as pouncing on toys or chasing
              after moving objects, as it's instinctual for them.
            </li>
            <li>
              House cats are known for their love of napping and sleeping. On
              average, they sleep for about 12 to 16 hours a day, conserving
              their energy for bursts of activity and hunting. Cats are
              crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during twilight
              hours—dawn and dusk—reflecting their natural hunting instincts.
